# Weather-Application
GUI Based weather app. Input Country, State, and/or City and see results! 
My personal API Key is on here from weatherAPI, but I really don't care. Use it to your liking, I guess..?
Essentially, you'll open the application, after you import PyQt5; QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets, and requests; json, and enter your desired country/state/city. 
After doing so, feast your eyes on the glorious, instantanious weather update in that area! You may want to make sure it's spelled properly, however, because this
application is not very interactive. It won't give you any errors. In fact, I set a try except that did nothing if it errors. So... use at full disclosure that I am 
not responsible for deaths that may occur. 
Have fun. Probably not gonna, but that's also okay.
